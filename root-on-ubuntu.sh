# Note that this is not recommended until and unless you are an expert and aware of what you are typing or doing:
$ sudo -i

# OR
$ sudo -s

# Above command will start /bin/bash as a root shell so that you can enter a root user command without using sudo command.

# How do I login as root user?
# Open the terminal application and simply type the following sudo command
$ sudo bash

# OR
$ sudo -s
